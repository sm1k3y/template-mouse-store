# Mouse Store ApexMouse
A simple React.js based gaming mouse store template that supports a database and EmailJS built for my university project.

## How to launch

To launch, navigate to the `./api-server/` directory and run the command `node index.js`.

Then, in a separate process, navigate to the `./mouse-store/` directory and use the command `npm start`.
After this, the page should automatically launch in your default browser.
